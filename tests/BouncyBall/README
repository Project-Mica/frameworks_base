This is a simple graphics app which draws a ball bouncing around a screen.

This app is intended for use in automated testing (for example, to make sure
no frames are dropped while running).  It can also be run manually, but there's
a fundamental assumption that this is the only foreground app running on the
device while testing.


From the top of tree, in a shell that has been set up for building, this app
can be built with:

$ mmma -j frameworks/base/tests/BouncyBall

And then installed with:

$ adb install ${ANDROID_PRODUCT_OUT}/system/app/BouncyBallTest/BouncyBallTest.apk

This can be launched via automation with:

$ adb shell am start com.prefabulated.bouncyball/com.prefabulated.bouncyball.BouncyBallActivity
