/**
 * SQLite table for storing aggregated app op access events.
 * Each row summarizes the count of accessed, rejected events, and duration sum that occurred
 * within a specific time window (e.g., 1 or 15 minutes). This aggregation helps in efficiently
 * storing the app op
 * access events.
 *
 * <p>The following columns form a composite key to uniquely identify an aggregated record
 * for a given time window. App op events sharing identical values for these fields within the
 * same time window are grouped together, and their occurrences are counted in
 * {@link Columns#TOTAL_ACCESS_COUNT} and {@link Columns#TOTAL_REJECT_COUNT}.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Columns#UID}: UID.</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#PACKAGE_NAME}: Package name.</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#DEVICE_ID}: Device Id.</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#OP_CODE}: OP code.</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#ATTRIBUTION_TAG}: Attribution tag.</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#UID_STATE}: The state of the UID (e.g., foreground, background).</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#OP_FLAGS}: App op flags.</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#ATTRIBUTION_FLAGS}: Attribution flags.</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#CHAIN_ID}: Attribution chain id.</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#ACCESS_TIME}: Discretizd access time.</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#DURATION}: Discretized duration.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Aggregated values stored for each unique key combination within a time window are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link Columns#TOTAL_ACCESS_COUNT}: Total access counts.</li>
 * <li>{@link Columns#TOTAL_REJECT_COUNT}: Total reject counts.</li>
