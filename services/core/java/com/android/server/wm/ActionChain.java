/**
 * Represents a chain of WM actions where each action is "caused by" the prior action (except the
 * first one of course). A whole chain is associated with one Transition (in fact, the purpose
 * of this object is to communicate, to all callees, which transition they are part of).
 *
 * A single action is defined as "one logical thing requested of WM". This usually corresponds to
 * each ingress-point into the process. For example, when starting an activity:
 *   * the first action is to pause the current/top activity.
 *       At this point, control leaves the process while the activity pauses.
 *   * Then WM receives completePause (a new ingress). This is a new action that gets linked
 *       to the prior action. This action involves resuming the next activity, at which point,
 *       control leaves the process again.
 *   * Eventually, when everything is done, we will have formed a chain of actions.
 *
 * We don't technically need to hold onto each prior action in the chain once a new action has
 * been linked to the same transition; however, keeping the whole chain enables improved
 * debugging and the ability to detect anomalies.
