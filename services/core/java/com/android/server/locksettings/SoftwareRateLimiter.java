/**
 * This is the software rate-limiter used by LockSettingsService. It rate-limits guesses of LSKFs
 * (Lock Screen Knowledge Factors), complementing the "hardware" (TEE or Secure Element)
 * rate-limiter provided by the Gatekeeper or Weaver HAL.
 *
 * <p>This has several purposes:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Keep track of recent wrong guesses, and reject duplicate wrong guesses before they reach
 *       the hardware rate-limiter and actually count as wrong guesses. This is helpful for
 *       legitimate users who may mis-enter their LSKF in the same way multiple times. It does not
 *       help capable attackers, for whom duplicate wrong guesses provide no additional information.
 *       Overall, this logic makes it feasible to more strictly rate-limit (unique) wrong guesses,
 *       which increases security. It also eliminates the need for all hardware rate-limiter
 *       implementations to implement the same duplicate wrong detection logic.
 *   <li>Enable faster validation and deployment of rate-limiter improvements, before mirroring
 *       those same changes in the hardware rate-limiters which tends to take longer.
 *   <li>Serve as a fallback just in case the hardware rate-limiter (which is a vendor component)
 *       does not work properly. The software and hardware rate-limiters operate concurrently, so
 *       the stricter of the two is what is normally observed. Of course, a properly implemented
 *       hardware rate-limiter is more secure and is always supposed to be present too.
 *   <li>Reject guesses of too-short LSKFs before they count as real guesses.
 *   <li>Log LSKF authentication attempts to <code>statsd</code>.
 * </ol>
