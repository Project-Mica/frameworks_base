/**
 * Returns a remembered view-model of the type [T]. If the returned instance is also an
 * [Activatable], it's automatically kept active until this composable leaves the composition; if
 * the [key] changes, the old view-model is deactivated and a new one will be instantiated,
 * activated, and returned.
 *
 * The [traceName] is used for coroutine performance tracing purposes. Please try to use a label
 * that's unique enough and easy enough to find in code search; this should help correlate
 * performance findings with actual code. One recommendation: prefer whole string literals instead
 * of some complex concatenation or templating scheme.
 *
 * The remembered view-model is activated every time the [minActiveState] is reached and deactivated
 * each time the lifecycle state falls "below" the [minActiveState]. This can be used to have more
 * granular control over when exactly a view-model becomes active.
 *
 * Note that, by default, `rememberViewModel` will activate its view-model in the [CoroutineContext]
 * from which it was called. To configure this, either pass a [coroutineContext] to this method or
 * use [WithConfiguredRememberViewModels] to bulk-configure all usages of `rememberViewModel`s
 * within the composable hierarchy. If you do both, the provided [coroutineContext] takes precedence
 * over the [WithConfiguredRememberViewModels] one.
