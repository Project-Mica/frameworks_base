# A list of methods that are found to be latency sensitive. We have this manual
# due to current limitations of our boot image profiling, where knowing what
# methods are latency sensitive is difficult. For example, this method is executed
# in the system server, not on the UI thread of an app.

# and is captured with the boot image profiling pipeline.
